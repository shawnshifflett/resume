This is my resume written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

This resume is based off a template I discovered modified by Scott Clark. See the (C) list at the top of the LaTeX code for a history.

I have also included the original templates along with my resume.

Feel free to fork and edit.

In linux run
```bash
$ pdflatex resumeName.tex
```
This should result in the creation of ``resumeName.pdf``

My template was tested and published in [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com)
